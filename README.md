# Depthboot: your **Chromebook**, your way

Choose between a variety of common Linux distributions and desktop environments to create a bootable image for any
64-bit Chromebook.

Due to licensing restraints, Depthboot cannot be distributed as an iso. Instead, it has to be built locally.

You can alternatively use [EupneaOS](https://github.com/eupnea-linux/eupnea-os) which offers pre-built ISOs.

## Depthboot vs Mainline

(Mainline = stock, unmodified Linux distribution)

**Mainline Linux:**

* Requires either replacing firmware completely (UEFI) or changing a part of it (rw_legacy). Not all devices have both
  options and there is a slight risk of bricking the Chromebook.
* Some hardware may not work (touchscreen, touchpad, etc.)
* Audio is mostly unsupported.

**Depthboot:**

* Requires no modifications to firmware.
* Hardware support matches ChromeOS.
* Extensive audio support, with active development to bring further support.

## Credit

* Depthboot is based on [Breath](https://github.com/cb-linux/breath) by MilkyDeveloper. Breath was active from Apr 2021
  until its archival in late Aug 2022.
* All Eupnea Project icons were made by [Inderix](https://github.com/Inderix).
